## IIIF Manifest ML/AI Usage Tags

The first set of specialized tags was [proposed during the 2024 IIIF Annual Conference, for use within IIIF Manifests](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18rggHeFld7HOJefmVc6ku_7M5edLfgfZkpnQZiagSOA/edit?usp=share_link). 

The enclosing IIIF folder in this repository will serve as a working studio space for initial creation and editing, while working with the IIIF Community towards a [IIIF Cookbook Recipe Set](https://github.com/IIIF/cookbook-recipes).
