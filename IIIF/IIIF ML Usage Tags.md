## IIIF Manifest ML/AI Usage Tags

The first set of specialized tags was [proposed during the 2024 IIIF Annual Conference, for use within IIIF Manifests](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18rggHeFld7HOJefmVc6ku_7M5edLfgfZkpnQZiagSOA/edit?usp=share_link). 

This IIIF folder and set of documents serves as a working studio space for initial creation and editing, while working with the IIIF Community towards a [IIIF Cookbook Recipe Set](https://github.com/IIIF/cookbook-recipes). 

## IIIF Cookbook Recipe Versions

Following along with the [IIIF Cook Recipe Process and Templates](https://github.com/IIIF/cookbook-recipes/blob/master/recipe/index.md), please see the corresponding [ml-usage-tags folder](/ml-usage-tags). 

### Initial Tags Proposed

For use within `requiredStatement` for humans and `rights` for machines.

Using language and standards based on larger Creative Community’s (DevianArt & others) “noai” and “noimageai” tags, and licenses from [RightsStatements.org](https://rightsstatements.org/en/): 

* No AI
    * no image or textual ML/AI at all
* No Image AI
    * no image-based ML/AI, but textual (metadata, ocr, transcript) use ok
* Regulated AI
    * ML/AI Use Permitted - with attribution
    * ML/AI Use Permitted - with express written consent and attribution

### Additional Considerations

For wider discussion and consideration with other IIIF Community members/users:
* Simple use cases (apply per manifest) versus complex uses casses (apply per item/canvas)
