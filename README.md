# Ethical ML/AI Usage Tags Project

Libraries, archives, museums, and other cultural heritage organizations are dedicated to collecting, preserving, and providing access to a wonderful milieu of research, historical, and cultural resources around the world.

We are all living through yet another transformative era when the fundamental drivers of Internet content creation, curation, and reuse are shifting as massive Machine Learning (ML; and sometimes also termed AI) applications reform our shared digital landscape. In response to these shifting sands, professionals in the overlapping fields of Library and Information, Museum, and Computer Sciences need to rethink the ways we can best provide quality research and reuse interactions for our richly described content shared through digital repository environments. The unregulated consumption of data and resources by ML/AI-powered bots and harvesters is increasingly more tenuous and challenges our well established ideas of what openness means. 

We strongly believe in the value of creating consensus and shared practices in our own community for combating this significant challenge.

This Github repository is dedicated to the creation and management of specialized, standardized tags and rights/access statements to be used within the metadata records and schemas applied when sharing digital repository and/or collections content.

## IIIF Manifest ML/AI Usage Tags

The first set of these specialized tags was [proposed during the 2024 IIIF Annual Conference, for use within IIIF Manifests](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18rggHeFld7HOJefmVc6ku_7M5edLfgfZkpnQZiagSOA/edit?usp=share_link). 

The enclosing IIIF folder in this repository will serve as a working studio space for initial creation and editing, while working with the IIIF Community towards a [IIIF Cookbook Recipe Set](https://github.com/IIIF/cookbook-recipes). 

## Wikidata

Wikidata Items were created to share referenceable statements within a wider context.

* [No AI Statement](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q127515624)
* [No Image AI Usage Statement](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q127516405)
* [Regulated ML/AI Use Permitted - Attribution Required Statement](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q127516763)
* [Regulated ML/AI Use Permitted - Consent Required Statement](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q127518037)

Please see the full [Wikidata Items document](wikidata-items.md) for more details. 

## SKOS & Turtle Versions of the Statements

SKOS & Turtle serialized versions of the four statements to be crafted during the later half of 2024. 

## Stable URIs Development and Maintenance

Late 2024/early 2025 goal for this project: the development of stables URIs published from this project repository to best ensure machineable interactions and long term maintenance of these standarized statements. The Wikidata Items and SKOS & Turtle Versions of these Statements will be updated to reflect back to the stable URIs (similar to the structures of other existing standarized rights statements used within library, archives, and cultural heritage contexts).
